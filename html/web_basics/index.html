	<h1>Muffin Man Sighting Puts Town On High Alert</h1>
	<h3>Can <em>you</em> believe it?</h3>
		<p><strong>Once upon a time</strong>, there was a man who lived on the outskirts of town. Introverted and misunderstood he liked living on the fray. He spent his life searching for clues about the existence of the Muffin Man. His life turned upside down the fretful day when the Muffin Man actually came to town. He knew the town wouldn't believe him about what he saw. So he devised a letter, in which he stated his evidence he had found! His letter follows:
	<h5>My evidence</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>The waft of blueberry through the air was sos trong even Betty Lou could smell him</li>
				<li>Bite of muffin Old Yeller returned with from his daily stroll</li>
				<li>Muffin remains on the fence</li>
			</ul>
	<h5>The three best ways we can take action are:</h5>
			<p>See! You must believe me! </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Harvest our blueberries now. He is here to replenish!</li>
				<li>Set booby traps in the fields.</li>
				<li>Release the hounds.</li>
			</ol>
