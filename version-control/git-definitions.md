# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* Version control saves all the past versions of your files. This enables you to go back to old, stable code if your new code introduces a bug.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch is a place where we can experiment with new code before bringing it back into our master branch, or production code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* A commit is a save point or check point for Git. These are the points you can go rewind your project back. A good message gives a brief detailed account of the changes made since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
	* A merge conflict occur when trying to bring branches back into the master. If code has changed since it was cloned to a local computer, you will have to choose which code to /'override/' and merge to master.

* Version control is a way of "saving" or rather committing, every change made to code in order to prevent conflicts and issues when trying to build additional features.
* A branch is a small chunk of code to add to the "master" part of the repo slowly over time. You work in branches in order to not destroy the part of your code that is fundamental and works.
* A commit is the same thing as saving your code. This is good practice to do on a regular basis.
* A merge conflict is when you try to merge new code into your current working files and something is incorrectly labeled or the new changes are incompatible.
