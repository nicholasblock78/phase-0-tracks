# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	* Version control saves all the past versions of your files. This enables you to go back to old, stable code if your new code introduces a bug. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	* A branch is a place where we can experiment with new code before bringing it back into our master branch, or production code. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	* A commit is a save point or check point for Git. These are the points you can go rewind your project back. A good message gives a brief detailed account of the changes made since the last commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
	* A merge conflict occur when trying to bring branches back into the master. If code has changed since it was cloned to a local computer, you will have to choose which code to /'override/' and merge to master.
